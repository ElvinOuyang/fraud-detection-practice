# Fraud Detection Practice

In this project, I am using `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit Learn`, and `PyTorch` packages with Python to test fraud detection models with Kaggle's [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/data) database. The database has been anonymized with a PCA model in preprocessing and includes 28 dense PCA features. Apart from these PCA features, two actual features - 'Time' and 'Amount' - are created by the database creator.
